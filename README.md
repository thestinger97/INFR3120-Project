Project part 1. Full CRUD application. Theme of the website: Hall of Champions. A website where users can add/edit/delete wrestlers and compare their stats which are showed in a table. The application is connected to cloud MongoDB using mongoose. Not much focus on css since it was said the site doesn't have to be pretty at this stage just functional.
